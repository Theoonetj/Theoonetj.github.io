Why I decided to becone a software engineer?
Before deciding on software engineering, like most college students I’d changed my major a few times. During one of my general study semesters, I took an intro to computer networking class because some of my friends were taking the same class. The goal was to get an easy A. Rumors had it that the professor was nice and very lenient. 
By the completion of my general studies, I had done some research, taken a few more computer science classes and concluded that software engineering it was. 
Below are some main reasons for my choice. 

•	The skills are transferable.
•	Work anywhere.
•	Comfortable Working Environment.
•	Constant learning curve.
•	You can be as creative as you want.
•	Job security
•	Passion for building thing.
